        <h1 class="What">What is an ETF</h1>
        <p>An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is a type of financial instrument that combines the characteristics of an individual stock and an investment fund. It works similarly to an investment fund in that it pools financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities or other instruments, and allows investors to buy a stake in that pool of assets.</p>
        <p>However, unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, giving them liquidity and the ability to be bought and sold during market trading hours. This means that investors can buy or sell shares of an ETF at any time during the trading day, just as they would with an individual stock.</p>
        <p>ETFs typically have lower management costs than traditional mutual funds and offer diversification through investing in a diverse portfolio of assets. They can also be an efficient way to gain exposure to specific sectors, geographic regions or investment strategies, as there are specialized ETFs in a wide variety of investment areas.</p>
